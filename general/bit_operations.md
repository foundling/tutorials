# Bit Operations

In this article, I'm going to explore the relationship between binary and hexidecimal numbers and talk about some basic ways to take advantage of binary operators.

# Base-2 Number System

If you were to adopt a `base-2` number system for everyday counting, you might be setting yourself up for frustration. To count a bag of apples in powers of 2 when you have ten fingers seems a bit impractical.  It's a commonly held belief that that human anatomy accounts for the fact that counting in groups of 10 is more intuitive. 

So, why binary? 

Given that we naturally conceive of propositions as being either `true` or `false`, the idea of a `base-2` *number* system isn't too far-off. [Claude Shannon/ George Boole reference]. 

Binary turns out to be quite useful for representing information in a compact and simple manner in computers. Like the decimal system, it is positional, representing increasing powers of twos. But where the `decimal` system has 10 possible values, the `binary` system has just 1 or 0. Presence or absence.  The base-2 number system has as its simplest unit a binary digit, or `bit`, which can be either 0 or 1.
